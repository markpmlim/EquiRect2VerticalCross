Instead of converting an EquiRectangular projection of a scene to a cubemap texture make up of six 2D textures, we explore the possibilty of directing rendering a vertical crossmap cubemap texture from a 2:1 EquiRectangular image.

Since a vertical cross cubemap can be rendered from an ordinary (six 2D) cubemap texture, we can use the idea of deriving a pair of texture coordinates for a given face.

Referring to the Rendermann specifications:
